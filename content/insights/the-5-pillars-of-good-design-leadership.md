Throughout the years, we had the opportunity to work with many different types of companies at different life-cycle points, each facing their unique challenges. The points mentioned in this article should help to achieve meaningful and sustainable change. We believe this is the best way to ensure a good return on investment for our clients too. We also believe adapting these pillars to other roles, such as project management or product ownership, should provide a stable ground to build user experience-friendly leadership and ship highly successful digital products.

Listen First
A good design leader recognizes that their primary role is not to teach but to listen. Understanding the team and the context they operate in is the starting point before trying to change anything. Excellent communication and being humble is imperative.

Find purpose
Probably there is a good purpose for your team to exist. The leader has to find it and phrase it in a way that is powerful and can be effectively communicated. Good leaders are storytellers who can create narratives that can inspire every stakeholder involved.

Create alliances
Communicate the purpose inside the team as well as to all stakeholders around. The leader is responsible for being the voice of the team internally as well as externally. If the alignment is achieved in the organization and within the team, you will be able to create great things together. 

Balance structure and flexibility
Recognize the potential in your team and trust them to be independent creative problem-solvers. Some structure is necessary, but make sure to provide enough freedom and flexibility too. Product design is not like an assembly line. You are managing humans, not machines. 

Adapt goals and monitor
Design leaders can identify countless opportunity areas to improve in an organization, but how should they prioritize? Taking the design maturity of your organization into account will give a great basis for understanding where to start and what direction to go. Also, we shouldn’t forget to look back often to monitor the completion of our goals. Don’t let the calendar take control. Base decisions on observations and insights.

In our experience, keeping these points have proven to be useful in the context of product design and beyond. Leadership as a topic is an extensive and broad area of science, and many other aspects are essential, such as intrapersonal communication or managing resources, just to mention a few. Here, we are only concentrating on leadership in relation to design for digital products and services. Our aim is to provide a clear and memorable mental checklist for leaders when they have to think about maximizing return on investment in design and research activities using our own experiences.
