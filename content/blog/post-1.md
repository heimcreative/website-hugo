Every four to eight years we get a new President of the United States, and with them a new whitehouse.gov to represent the people. Each administration makes the site a showcase of their agendas and values. The Biden-Harris administration is committed to building an America that is more inclusive, more just, and more accessible for every American, including Americans with disabilities and their families. These values shine in the newly updated whitehouse.gov website.

### A site structure that benefits screen readers

Not readily apparent to the average user is the site’s underlying structure—the browser’s markup to display the site. While most of us are completely oblivious to this aspect of the site as we’re navigating, the structure is fundamental to screen reader users. While screen readers read the content of the page to the user, they also convey additional information—whether a menu is expanded or collapsed, the hierarchy of the page and what the main topics of the page are, what section of a page (i.e., header, footer, sidebar, main content) a piece of content belongs to, etc. These relationships between the site’s text content help convey to a blind user what sighted people see on the page visually and usually take for granted and don’t even think about. 

The site uses headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) and landmark elements (header, footer, main, aside, etc.) properly and effectively. Properly marked-up headings allow a screen reader user to get a sense of the page’s overall content and the most important pieces of content on the page without having to listen to the entire page.
