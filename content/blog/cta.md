User-focused design solves the problems of site visitors before they even knew they had a problem.

### 1. Limit Items on the Page

Have you ever visited a website and found there were so many competing elements on the page that you didn't know what to look at first?

This is phenomenon is known as [Hick’s Law](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users), which states that the more options users have, the longer they take to make a decision. Not an ideal user experience.

Narrowing your design’s focus to a single location throws the visitor's attention to your call to action and helps avoid confusion. The user doesn't have to wonder what action they should take, because the primary action is the most obvious.

### 2. Use First-Person Language

First-person language personalizes your CTA and encourages the user to click on it. For example, when inviting site visitors to subscribe to a newsletter, you might write "Sign Up for Our Newsletter."

However, there’s evidence to suggest tweaking the language a bit might improve conversions, such as writing "Get My Free Newsletter." First-person language is conversational and helps create a more personalized approach

### 3. Know Your Audience

You've likely heard the advice before to know your target audience and create a buyer persona which represents your typical customer. Dig into your own customer database and study statistics on who is visiting your site. You can also look at your competitors, and who their customers are, to get a feel for market segments you should reach out to.

Once you know your audience, it's easier to know how you should word your CTA, what type of offers appeal most to that demographic and where to market your offers.

### 4. Test Different Colors

There are numerous articles online about the best color to use for your CTA. There’s even an entire psychological category for the emotions different colors trigger in people. For example, if you know most of your audience is made up of young women, you might use a color which appeals to both women and the youths more than older men.

The truth is that it's impossible to predict exactly how a color might impact your users. You must test different color choices and even different shades of the same color until you find the perfect choice for your audience. A/B split testing is one of the best methods for figuring out which colors resonate best with your audience.

### 5. Check for Mobile Responsiveness

A user-centered approach is one of the key determining factors in how likely mobile users are to stay on your page. Those who surf your site on mobile platforms are more likely to bounce away from your site if it isn't optimized for mobile.

Your CTA must respond to the changing screen size of different visitors. A significant portion of your traffic will probably come from smartphones, so test your site on different platforms and see how it responds on iOS and Android.

Forms can be particularly challenging for mobile users to fill out, so see how well yours responds and make any adaptations needed for ease of use.

### Improve Your Conversion Rate

A strong, user-centered approach drives the buyer through the steps you'd like them to take and results in a better conversion rate. Your CTA is one of the most important features in your user’s journey.

It shows people what steps to take next and grabs attention at the right moment. Even the minutest details of your CTA can increase your conversions and improve your bottom line.
